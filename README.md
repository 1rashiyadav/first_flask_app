# First Flask App

## Instructions:

1. Fork this repo by clicking the **Fork** button at the top right of the GitHub window.
2. Click the green **Clone or download** button. A box will drop down from the button. Click on the text in the text box, then click on the clipboard button to the right of the text box to copy the text.
3. Open a new console and type `git clone url` where `url` is the text that you copied from the last step. You can paste the url by pressing _CTRL_ + _v_ on the keyboard. Don't forget there's a space between the word `clone` and the url.
4. Press _ENTER_. You'll see some text indicating that git is pulling down files from GitHub.
5. If everything worked, you're all set!
